## 🧠 Core Technologies & Skills

This repository showcases my experience across several core networking technologies, including:

### 🛠️ **Routing & Switching**
- **Dynamic Routing**: Proficient in configuring and troubleshooting routing protocols like **OSPF**, **RIP**, and **EIGRP** for IPv4. 
- **VLANs & Subnetting**: Expertise in designing VLANs, subnetting, and inter-VLAN routing to efficiently segment and route traffic across large networks.
- **Ethernet Switching**: Deep knowledge of **EtherChannel**, **VTP**, **STP** (Spanning Tree Protocol), and **RSTP** to ensure high-performance and fault-tolerant Layer 2 networks.

### 🔐 **Network Security**
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**: Strong understanding of configuring **standard** and **extended ACLs** to secure network traffic.
- **Port Security**: Implementing **Port Security** features to prevent unauthorized access and mitigate Layer 2 attacks.
- **DHCP Snooping & Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI)**: Configuring and securing **DHCP** and **ARP** to protect from **spoofing** and **man-in-the-middle** attacks.

### 🖧 **Redundancy & High Availability**
- **HSRP & VRRP**: Configuring **HSRP** and **VRRP** for **redundant gateways**, ensuring seamless failover and network reliability.
- **Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)**: Mastering **Root Guard**, **BPDU Guard**, and **PortFast** to prevent network loops and improve failover times.

### 🌍 **Vendor-Specific Expertise**
- **Cisco**: Hands-on experience with **Cisco Packet Tracer** and **GNS3**, simulating and configuring **routers** and **switches** for real-world scenarios.
- **MikroTik**: Practical knowledge of **MikroTik RouterOS**, including advanced routing, NAT, firewalling, and VLAN configuration.
- **Huawei**: Experience working with **Huawei eNSP**, implementing **VRRP**, **ACLs**, and routing protocols in **Huawei-based environments**.

### 🧑‍💻 **Automation & Management**
- **Network Automation**: Exploring **Python** (with **Netmiko** and **Paramiko**) to automate routine network tasks, including device configurations and troubleshooting.
- **Syslog & SNMP**: Integrating network devices with **Syslog** servers for log management and **SNMP** for monitoring network health.

## 🧑‍💻 Why This Portfolio?

This portfolio reflects **real-world** network configurations and designs. Each project has been created from scratch, documented, and simulated to mimic **enterprise environments**. Whether I’m working on **routing**, **security**, or **network redundancy**, I approach each lab as if it were part of a live network.

I also focus on **clear documentation** to ensure my designs can be easily understood, maintained, and extended by other engineers in the future.
